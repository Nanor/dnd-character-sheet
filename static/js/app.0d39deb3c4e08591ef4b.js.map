You can also create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><p>- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</p><p>- You allow a maximum of twenty creatures you can see to get all their points and you dispel all effects affecting them, as described in greater restoration spell.</p><p>- You grant to a maximum of ten creatures you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</p><p>- You grant to a maximum of ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For example, you can immunize yourself and your companions against the attack of the Lich draining.</p><p>- You cancel a recent event unique by requiring a new replacement jet diced any jet made during the last round (including your last turn). The reality is transformed to match the new launch. For example, a wish spell can cancel a successful saving throw enemy critical strike an opponent or ally saving throw missed. You can impose a jet with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose to use the new result of the start or the old.</p><p>You can also do other things than the above examples. Describe your wishes to your MD in the most accurate way possible. The DM is free to determine what happens in this case; more desire, the more likely it is that something goes wrong. This spell may simply fail, the effect you want might be only partially executed, or you may suffer from unpredictable consequences depending on your formulation wish. For example, want an enemy died could propel you to a future time when your enemy is no longer alive, you effectively eliminating the game. Similarly, desiring a legendary magical object or artifact could carry you instantaneously in the presence of the current owner of the object.</p><p>Stress to cast this spell to produce an effect other than the reproduction of another spell weakens you. After undergoing this tension every time you cast a spell, and this until your next extended rest, you suffer 1d10 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage can not be reduced or avoided in any way. In addition, your Force falls to 3, if it is not already less than 3, for 2d4 days. For each day spent resting or practicing a minor activity, your recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, you have a 33% chance of never being able to cast the spell if you wish undergoes stress.</p>\",\n\t\t\t\"class\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"Sorcerer\",\n\t\t\t\t\"Wizard\"\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\"concentration\": false,\n\t\t\t\"casting_time\": \"1 action\",\n\t\t\t\"duration\": \"Instantaneous\",\n\t\t\t\"school\": \"Conjuration\",\n\t\t\t\"ritual\": false,\n\t\t\t\"components\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"V\"\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\"level\": 9,\n\t\t\t\"range\": \"Self\",\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Wish\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"higher_level\": \"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.\",\n\t\t\t\"page\": \"phb 289\",\n\t\t\t\"desc\": \"<p>A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target.

For example, you can immunize yourself and your companions against the attack of the Lich draining.</p><p>- You cancel a recent event unique by requiring a new replacement jet diced any jet made during the last round (including your last turn).

You can impose a jet with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose to use the new result of the start or the old.</p><p>You can also do other things than the above examples.
